## Features

This is the list of features, not the specification of what will or won't work. HyperMarkdown will, by default, have these markups:


### Commonmark

A straight, direct implementation of [Commonmark](https://spec.commonmark.org). 

No need to re-explain. If you're here, you'll know that this is the accepted baseline. HyperMarkdown always defers to Commonmark.

### CriticMarkup

[CriticMarkup](http://criticmarkup.com) directly:

Addition {++ ++}

Deletion {-- --}

Substitution {~~ ~> ~~}

Comment {>> <<}

Highlight {== ==} or {>> <<}



### MultiMarkdown



### GFM



### MathJax
