When this warning is removed, a version has been achieved. I'm taking a good, hard look at this, because there are some things that might be \"enough\", and that they just need codified. We all know the story. John Gruber and Aaron Swartz makes Markdown , and suddenly there's an itch scratched. A simple, readable format to text that is transferrable and can be rendered everywhere. But there's one problem. A very big problem. There are so many more things that Markdown can and should do, everyone went off and made the thing they needed. Github made the most headway with GFM, but MultiMarkdown does some great stuff. Critic Markup. All the Python extensions. More and more and more... And so it is time to evolve. Text became Hypertext. Now Markdown becomes Hypermarkdown. What is it? \u00b6 Hypermarkdown is a specification. It seeks to unify several different ideas while never violating the original concept of human-readable text as source. To start with, there is no compiler yet. The first part of this project is to lay out what and how, and then a spec will drive development. Concept and Compatibility \u00b6 Axiom: All Hypermarkdown files must be plain text. Hypermarkdown files should have the extension .hmd, or .hypermd Hypermarkdown styles should have the extension .hcss, or .hypercss Hypermarkdown files stand on their own with formatting according to the Hypermarkdown spec. This means that every Commonmark format will work, no matter what. Info Axiom: The Commonmark specification is a complete subset within Hypermarkdown. Hypermarkdown styles can be fashioned in an accompanying file. This means that if file.hmd and file.hcss exist in the same path, the style is automatically applied. Info Axiom: All Hypermarkdown files will automatically obey its accompanying .hcss file for style. Secondarily, within any path, a special name of hyperstyle.hcss will apply its rules second, but are available to all files in that path. Info Axiom: All Hypermarkdown files will automatically obey hyperstyle.hcss in its path, secondarily. If a hyperstyle.hcss is not found, rendering will go up one level and check until it runs out of levels, or finds a hyperstyle.hcss file. Info Axiom: Rendering will attempt to find hyperstyle.hcss in higher paths unless told not to look. All .hcss file content must start with: Use hyperstyle = \"no\" or Use hyperstyle = \"yes\" And the default will be \"no\" And that's it for files.
